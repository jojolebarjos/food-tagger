# Food Tagger

Recipe parser, which extract information from ingredient lines. Based on [my ontology](https://github.com/jojolebarjos/food-ontology).


# ToDo list

 * Use simple linear CRF for entity tagging
 * Link to ontology
 * Use hierarchical logistic regression to classify items
 * Annotate and infer relationships between entities
 * Tiny webservice for active learning
 * Properly package as a Python module
 * Provide webservice as a docker container
